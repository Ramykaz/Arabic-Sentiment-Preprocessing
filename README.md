# Arabic Sentiment Preprocessing  

This repository contains Python scripts for **preprocessing Arabic sentiment datasets**, focusing on text cleaning, tokenization, feature extraction, and retweet network analysis. The goal is to enhance data quality for **sentiment classification models**, particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on word embeddings (GloVe, Skip-Gram, CBOW).  

This project was part of my **research internship under Prof. Hala Mulki** at **Ortadoğu Araştırmaları Merkezi - ORSAM**. My primary contribution was **data preprocessing and analysis**, ensuring the dataset was optimized for deep learning-based sentiment classification.
